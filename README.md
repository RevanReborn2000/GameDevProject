# GameDevProject
Repository for our team game project.
This was the final project for CS 498: Game Development. The game was called "Ascension, and required the player to move through several levels within an office building, each level transporting him to a different world with clues as to how to leave the world. I was responsible for the final level before the celebration level, the end, and implemented a maze based around the theme of the "realm of dementia" from the Shivering Isles dlc found in Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.
